Create a js based music player. In the player there are three components. A js file, named script.js, a css file (named style.css) and a player html file. The player should have volume, next/previus track, shuffle button (on/off), repeat (one/all). A dedicated js file for storing the track array (including Track name, track url artist name, album name, album thumb image). The html will show these buttons in this order: Previous, Shuffle, Play/Pause, Next, Repeat. Use icon instead of text (may use fontawesome). All these buttons should be in one line. On the same line or below, show volume up down option.

Above the buttons should be track information from js file (Track name, artist name, album name).

Bug: When clicked play button should change to palying button and song should start playing. Not working. Albus art is also not showing.

Not working. When clicked on play, the song is not playing. Album art is also not viible. I've the files locally. The paths are okay. Could you check the script and tracks.js?


## NEW Player

Make an audio player from a csv file (songs.csv).
The columns are Song,album,singer,group,writer,tune,src,genre,subgenre,language,tags. The mp3 is included in src columns. From the csv, show 10 random songs as a set.
The player should be fixed on the bottom of the page. The controls icons should be arranged in this order: previous song, 10 sec backward, play/pause, 10 sec forward, next, repeat (1, all, none), song progress bar along with progress timer and duration at the end, volume. Use icons for all options including repeat 1, repeat all and shuffle on off.

Above the player, show the current playlist (song name, singer, group, album, play icon, downlaod icon (src link), with currently playing song highlighted.
