Follow this. It contains css and js files. Change the js file to add a shuffle and a repeat (all and single) button. Place it on the same line as previous and next song button.

Create a js based music player. In the player there are three components. A js file, named script.js, a css file (named style.css) and a player html file. The player should have volume, next/previus track, shuffle button (on/off), repeat (one/all). A dedicated js file for storing the track array (including Track name, track url artist name, album name, album thumb image). The html will show these buttons in this order: Previous, Shuffle, Play/Pause, Next, Repeat. Use icon instead of text (may use fontawesome). All these buttons should be in one line. On the same line or below, show volume up down option.

Above the buttons should be track information from js file (Track name, artist name, album name).

Bug: When clicked play button should change to palying button and song should start playing. Not working. Albus art is also not showing.

Not working. When clicked on play, the song is not playing. Album art is also not viible. I've the files locally. The paths are okay. Could you check the script and tracks.js?
